Avidly curious. I started coding at 12, one year after I got my first computer. I released a website in Php called allyrics.com at 13, one year after I got my first Internet connection. Since then, I taught myself a dozen different programming languages.

I am currently lead software engineer at Revinate, inc in San Francisco in Distributed Systems and Data Ingestion.
